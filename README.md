# Foxking EURUSD m15

This code represents an Expert Advisor (EA) for trading the EUR/USD currency pair on a 15-minute chart. The EA is designed to generate trading signals based on a user-defined trading strategy and execute corresponding buy or sell orders.

## Input Parameters

- `LotSize`: The trading lot size for each order.
- `StopLoss`: The stop loss level in pips.
- `TakeProfit`: The take profit level in pips.

## Global Variables

- `ticket`: The ticket number of the currently open order.

## Expert Initialization Function

The `OnInit` function is called during the initialization of the EA. Any required initialization code should be added here.

## Expert Deinitialization Function

The `OnDeinit` function is called when the EA is being deinitialized. Any required deinitialization code should be added here.

## Expert Start Function

The `OnTick` function is the main function of the EA and is called on each tick of the chart. This function performs the following steps:

1. Checks if the current bar is closed.
2. Calculates the trading signal using the `calculateSignal()` function.
3. Checks if there is an open order.
4. If an order is open, checks if it is closed and resets the order ticket if necessary.
5. If no order is open, checks the trading signal and opens a buy or sell order accordingly.

## Calculate Trading Signal

The `calculateSignal()` function is a placeholder for the user-defined trading strategy. Traders should add their own strategy code here to calculate the trading signal based on the current market conditions.
